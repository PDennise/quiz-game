## 🧠 Project Overview
**Quiz Game** is a web-based trivia app designed to test users’ knowledge through multiple-choice questions. Players answer each question, move to the next one, and see their final score at the end. In future updates, users will be able to enter their name and save their results.

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project was created to strengthen my front-end development skills — especially in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — by building a small, fully functional application.  
The main goal is to combine learning and fun through a clean and responsive interface.

### Objectives
- Create an easy-to-use and accessible interface  
- Implement a simple but effective quiz logic  
- Demonstrate practical use of front-end web technologies  

### Target Audience
- Anyone who enjoys trivia games  
- Beginners learning web development

## 🎨 Design
The interface follows a minimalist and user-friendly design philosophy. The layout is clean, responsive, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

- **index.html** — Main game page and start screen  
- **script.js** — Game logic, scoring system, and interactions  
- **style.css** — Visual design and responsive styling  
- **assets/** — Images, icons, or other static resources  

## ✅ Features
