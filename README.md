[Quiz Game](https://pdennise.github.io/quiz-game/) is a web-based trivia app designed to test users’ knowledge through multiple-choice questions. Players answer each question, move to the next one, and see their final score at the end. In future updates, users will be able to enter their name and save their results.

No special requirements — just a modern browser. If you want to run the project locally, you need:

- Node.js & npm (only if you later add build tools, but not required now)  
- Or simply a file browser / web server

---

### Installation & Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PDennise/quiz-game.git
2. Open the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd quiz-game
3. Open index.html in your browser to start playing the quiz.


Or (if you have a simple static server), run:

        npx serve
    
and open http://localhost:3000 in browser (optional).


## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project was created to strengthen my front-end development skills — especially in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — by building a small, fully functional application.  
The main goal is to combine learning and fun through a clean and responsive interface.

### Objectives
- Create an easy-to-use and accessible interface  
- Implement a simple but effective quiz logic  
- Demonstrate practical use of front-end web technologies  

### Target Audience

- Beginners learning web development  
- Users looking for a lightweight, browser-based game  

## 🎨 Design
The interface follows a minimalist and user-friendly design philosophy. The layout is clean, responsive, and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
